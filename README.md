# mytask

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
هذه التاسك هي لدورة مسار فلاتر التي كنت احد المشاركين بها للاستاذ فهد محفوظ  وهي بمثابة اختبار لمقدار فهمنا والاستفادة من الدورة
وهذه الدورة تابعة لمبادرة البرمجة من اجل العراق بقيادة الاستاذ المهندس محمد عيسى 


This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This task is a filter path course that I was one of the participants for Mr. Fahad Mahfouz and it serves as a test of how much we understand and benefit from the course.
This course is part of the Programming Initiative for Iraq led by Mr. Mohammed Issa
